## User Requirements

* As a new user, I want to be able to register, log in, and sign out, so that I have an account that stores my meal plan and donation information. 

* As a new user, I want to view my personalized account, so that I can know my current status on meal swipes and dining dollars. 

* As an NYU student, I want to donate meal swipes to the whole NYU community, so that others can get a meal if needed. 

* As a community-driven student, I want to see the amount of donations, so other students and I are more encouraged to make more donations to help others. 

* As an NYU student, I want to see what food purchases I made, so I can control my budget in meal swipes and dining dollars.
