## Stakeholders

Below is an interview with a stakeholder.

Interviewer: Benjamin DeWeese  
Stakeholder: Andy Li, Sophomore in CAS Computer Science with 120 Flex Plus meal plan.

Summary of goals/needs:

- It should feel simple. ideally, similar to Venmo.
- Be able to see current balance & spending history.
- Know how many swipes you have donated, as well as how many everybody else is donating.
- Be able to export your data.
- Integrate or Google or CILogin for easy sign-up.

Summary of problems/frustrations:

- The current website and physical solution are annoying. It is poorly advertised and you can only donate up to 3 swipes a day.
- There is no integrated mobile way to see meal swipe balance unless you connect to a GrubHub account. And your balance is not clear. You have to navigate confusing sub-menus to find it.
- [If I want to give a friend a swipe right now,] I have to physically tap my friend in, meaning, I have to be there with them.
- Apps that try to do everything are just bad. A pocket-knife becomes ineffective when it turns into a multi-tool with 30 moving pieces. It should just send and donate meals. There is no reason to integrate something like a chatbot.

## Product Vision Statement

This app should be a simple tool, capable of P2P sending and P2E donating of meal swipes, for NYU students.

## User Requirements

- As a new user, I want to be able to log in and sign out so that I have a protected account that stores my meal plan and donation information.

- As a new user, I want to view my personalized account so that I can know my current status on meal swipes and dining dollars.

- As an NYU student, I want to donate meal swipes to the whole NYU community so that others can get a meal if needed.

- As a community-driven student, I want to see the amount of donations so that other students and I are more encouraged to make more donations to help others.

- As an NYU student, I want to see what food purchases I made so that I can control my budget in meal swipes and dining dollars.

- As an NYU student, I want to specify a particular student's ID so that I can donate meal swipes to a friend.

- As an NYU student, I want to see some statistics about my meal swipe spending habit so that I can plan for donation or requesting for meal swipes from the community meal pool.

- As an NYU student, I want to see the dates of my meal swipe transactions so that I can keep track of my spending habit.

- As an NYU student, I want to specify the number of meal swipes to donate so that I can donate multiple meal swipes at a time.

- As an NYU student facing food insecurity, I want to request meal swipes from the community meal pool so that I don’t run out of meals.
